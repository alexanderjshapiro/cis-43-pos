# CIS 43-31019 Term Project: Point of Sale
*Modified Project Requirement:*

For this term, instead of a fully functional application, we are going to complete a "prototype".

In software, prototypes are typically barely functional visual representations of what a product might look like or do. They can be great sales tools, great tools for pitching investors, or a great way to get feedback before beginning actual development/coding.

We will follow the software development process up to the design stage and then minimum/no coding to allow the demo of the prototype.

At the end (the week before Finals week), you will demo the prototype during the lab session and you will need to submit a project documentation.
